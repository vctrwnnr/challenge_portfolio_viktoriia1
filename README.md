# Task 1: Software configuration
# Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
# My name is Viktoriia. I decided to participate in the project to gain knowledge and practical skills in testing. My goal is to get as much knowledge as possible. Also, this is good opportunity to work on a real project with practicing testers.
# I am sure everything will be great. ðŸ™‚
